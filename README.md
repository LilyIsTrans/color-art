# Colours - Clarified

The colours clarified crate is intended to make dealing with colour data in Rust *easy*.

It was originally forked from [color-art](https://github.com/JiatLn/color-art) by JiatLn
to add support for `serde`, but while waiting for my pull request to be accepted, I got 
ambitious, and decided to expand the scope a little.


Turns out, it will be better to just rewrite from scratch, so I'll do that instead.
